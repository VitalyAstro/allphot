ALLPHOT is a package designed to automate the ALLFRAME stellar
photometry package. 

The idea was to create scripts to run all ALLFRAME (DAOPHOT, DAOMATCH,
DAOMASTER, ALLFRAME) programs to be run unattended, but at the same
time using a friendly command line interface that allows to write scripts
quickly.

It was originally developed with the CANFAR project to re-run
photometry on MACHO data in the hope it can be applied to other big
data sets.

It could be used for other command line programs, its API is fairly
generic. The code was originally inspired by the "eselect" tool used
on Gentoo Linux, and shamefully borrows a lot of code from it, but it
diverged from it significantly.



Documentation
=============

* All commands are fancy wrappers around the ALLFRAME commands, so you will
  have to know how the original ALLFRAME commands work. Refer to the
  original documentation for more details.
  Typing "allphot <command> --help" will describe what you can do with
  it.

  For example, let's do a typical interactive DAOPHOT FIND command would sum
  up as follow, assuming you have a daophot.opt file:
 
	$ cat daophot.opt
	GA=1.6
	RE=5.5

	$ daophot
	[...snip...]
	 Command: attach image.fits
	[...snip...]
	 Command: find
	[...snip...]
               Number of frames averaged, summed: 1,1
          File for positions (default image.coo): 
	[...snip...]
		      Are you happy with this? Y
	 Command: exit

  You can get exactly the same result in two command lines using
  allphot, without any option file:

       $ allphot daophot opt --option GA=1.6 --option RE=5.5
       [...snip...]

       $ allphot daophot find image.fits
       [...snip...]

* There exists a very basic dictionnary generator to grab some values from a
  FITS header that will allow to build options files. Example:

       $ cat image.dict
       GA=fits(GAIN)
       RE=fits(RDNOISE)

       $ allphot daophot option --dict=image.dict image.fits


* To get a list of available modules, just run:

       $ allphot help

* The command line for each module is shown running:

       $ allphot <module> usage

* Most modules have default arguments that you can overwrite with
  command line options.

* There are also some example scripts in the directory "examples"
