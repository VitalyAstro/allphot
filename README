This is a attempt to package and automate a stellar photometry software called
DAOPHOT and its derivatives DAOMATCH, DAOMASTER, DAOGROW and
ALLFRAME. To read more about the software, please read the original
file README.txt, but do not pay attention to the installing part.

What has been changed from the original daophot-4.tar ball is
described in the ChangeLog file.

Installation instructions and requirements are in the INSTALL file.
Some documentation can be found in the doc directory.
