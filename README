ALLPHOT is a package designed to automate the ALLFRAME stellar
photometry package. 

The idea was to create scripts to run all ALLFRAME (DAOPHOT, DAOMATCH,
DAOMASTER, ALLFRAME) programs to be run unattended, but at the same
using a friendly command line interface that allows to write scripts
quickly .
It was originally developed with the CANFAR project to re-run photometry on MACHO
data in the hope it can be applied to other big data sets.

It could be used for other command line programs, its API is fairly
generic. The code is inspired by the "eselect" tool used on Gentoo Linux,
and shamefully borrows a lot of code from it.

Most commands are just wrappers around allframe commands. For example
a typical DAOPHOT FIND command would sum up as follow:

-------
% daophot


-------

This can be done in two command lines using allphot:
% allphot daophot opt
% allphot daophot find 


There is a very basic dictionnary generator to grab some values from a
FITS header that will allow to build options files. Example:


To get a list of available modules, just run:

% allphot help

The command line for each module is shown running:

% allphot <module> usage




Most modules have default arguments that you can overwrite with
command line options.

There are also some example scripts in the directory examples/.
