ALLPHOT is a package designed to automate the ALLFRAME stellar
photometry package. The idea was to create a fairly friendly interface
for all ALLFRAME programs to be run unattended. It was developed with
the CANFAR project to re-run photometry on MACHO data in the hope it
can be applied to other big data sets.

It could be used for other command line programs, its API is fairly
generic. The code is inspired by the "eselect" tool used on Gentoo,
and shamefully borrows a lot of code from it.
