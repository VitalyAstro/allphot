ALLPHOT - Stellar photometry automated
======================================

ALLPHOT is a package designed to automate the ALLFRAME stellar
photometry package. 
ALLPHOT consists of fancy wrapper scripts for all ALLFRAME (DAOPHOT, DAOMATCH,
DAOMASTER, ALLFRAME, MONTAGE2) programs to be run unattended. It has a friendly
command line interface that allows to write scripts quickly. It has
all the original commands parameters, but with built-in good default
values, so the user does not have to deal with thousands unknown
tweaks and directories.

It was originally developed with the CANFAR project to re-run
photometry on MACHO data in the hope it can be applied to other large
data sets.

It can be used from other command line programs, its API is fairly
generic. The code was originally inspired by the "eselect" tool used
on Gentoo Linux, and shamefully borrows a lot of code from it, but it
diverged from it significantly. It is written in pure bash, with some
C calls to deals with FITS files using cfitsio. 

Availability
============

The current stable version is available on http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~seb/
The development git is public on http://gitorious.org/tvs/allphot

Installation
============

See the INSTALL file.


Documentation
=============

* All commands are wrappers around the ALLFRAME commands, so it is
  very much advised to know how the original ALLFRAME commands
  work. Refer to the original DAOPHOT ALLFRAME papers and
  documentation for more details.

  Typing "allphot <command> --help" will describe what you can do with
  the particular <command>.

  All commands are straight forward and intuitive. For example, a
  typical interactive DAOPHOT FIND command would summarize as follow,
  assuming you have a daophot.opt file:
 
	$ cat daophot.opt
	GA=1.6
	RE=5.5

	$ daophot
	[...snip...]
	 Command: attach image.fits
	[...snip...]
	 Command: find
	[...snip...]
               Number of frames averaged, summed: 1,1
          File for positions (default image.coo): 
	[...snip...]
		      Are you happy with this? Y
	 Command: exit

  You can get exactly the same result in two non-interactive command
  lines using allphot:

       $ allphot daophot opt --option GA=1.6 --option RE=5.5
       [...snip...]

       $ allphot daophot find image.fits
       [...snip...]

* There is a very basic dictionnary generator to grab some values from a
  FITS header to help building options files. Example:

       $ cat image.dict
       GA=fits(GAIN)
       RE=fits(RDNOISE)

       $ allphot daophot option --dict=image.dict image.fits


* To get a list of available modules, just run:

       $ allphot help

* The command line for each module is shown running:

       $ allphot <module> usage

* To get a list of DAOPHOT submodules:

      $ allphot daophot list

* Most modules have default arguments that you can overwrite with
  command line options.

* There are also some example scripts in the directory "examples".
